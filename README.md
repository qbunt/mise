## mise
Mise en place (French pronunciation: ​[mi zɑ̃ ˈplas]) is a French culinary phrase which means "putting in place" or "everything in its place."

This is my development setup mostly automated through Homebrew and Casks for GUI or more complex installers.

### install

Run this in bash/zsh

```bash
// cd into this directory
brew bundle
```

### updates
